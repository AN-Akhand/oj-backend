**Bishop and King**

You have a 8✕8 chessboard with a bishop and a king. Can you attack the king with the bishop by moving it once?

The bishop is on the square with coordinate (**C1**, **R1**) and the king is on the square with coordinate (**C2**, **R2**). The king is not initially under attack.

Note: A bishop can only move diagonally and attack diagonally. The bishop will attack the king if they are on the same diagonal.

**Input:**

The first line contains a single integer **T**, the number of test cases. (**T** <![if !msEquation]><![if !vml]>![](file:///C:/Users/mobas/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif)<![endif]><![endif]> **500**)

Each test case has two lines. The first line contains two space separated integers **C1** and **R1** corresponding to the bishop’s position.

The second line contains two space separated integers **C2** and **R2** corresponding to the king’s position.

Here ***1 ≤C1, R1, C2, R2≤8. (C1, R1)*** and ***(C2, R2)*** are pairwise distinct.



**Output:**

For each test case print a single line. If you can attack the king by moving the bishop once, print YES. Otherwise print NO.
